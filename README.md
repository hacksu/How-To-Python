# How-To-Python
An introduction to Python and perhaps to programming in general.

### initial outline:

we're writing a program to keep track of all the books, that are on a shelf. this is how you store a book's title in a variable; we could make more variables, like book1, book2, etc, but actually we can just make a list. for loops let us iterate over every book in the list and print their name out. while loops let us accept book names from user input until they say "stop." if statements can be used to only store a book's name if it meets certain criteria, like having a minimum length. we can store numbers in variables and update them over time to keep track of how many books there are. we can also divide this code into functions called like count_books_with_this_title and print_books_out and call them as many times and in whatever order that we would like.

dicts can be used to map book names to book authors, so you can look up who wrote a certain book. you can also make a dict that stores a bunch of keys and a bunch of values for a book, so you can keep track of what year it was published and how many pages it has and stuff like that. then, you can make a whole list of dicts, to store this stuff for all of your books. do you wish you could put functions in your dict? make a class that has member functions and convert your list of dicts into a list of objects. there, now you can finally store your books on your bookshelf in an optimal form. if you want to save this data somewhere persistent, come to our database lesson. if you want to do a whole bunch of other stuff, come to all our other lessons too. if you couldn't get python working, i am so so sorry.

notes from katie:
 - we'd have to make sure that after it's written it's not super complicated, since we don't have like beginner and advanced lessons anymore, but that would be fun :D
 - you could even expand the "libaray" idea and make it like, a library of.....i dunno something fun, and then it'd have the "cute" or "fun" aspect to it too
